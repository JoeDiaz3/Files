The goal of this project is to develop a hedonic pricing model that can be used by Zillow or any real estate company to determine what property attributes impact a homeâ€™s sale price and to better predict future home prices. A hedonic pricing model considers variables that have been identified as statistically significant and attempts to provide an estimation of how the significant variable impacts the target variable. The dataset used in this project is the publicly available AMES housing dataset that consists of quantitative data. Although the dataset is large, it is missing meaningful spatial variables that are considered important when developing a hedonic price model (Skenteris et. al., 2019). The variables in the dataset are a good representation of real-world data that is available from sold homes, so this project provides an idea of how an organization can use home data to predict the future sales price.
